# About

This application's goal is to enable people in learning languages while conversing with native speakers.
It is not a standalone language-learning app; instead, it aims to provide translations for everyday phrases
while explaining the grammatical structure and vocabulary of those sentences.

lingolift uses a mixture of Generative AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to perform translation
and sentence analysis. For example, both the idiomatic translation of the input sentence and the literal
translations are generated by an LLM (currently using the OpenAI API); however, the syntactical analysis of sentences
is largely achieved using the spaCy library.

## Features

As of now, lingolift can do the following:

- Auto-detect the language of the input sentence
- Translate sentences from other languages to English
- Provide a literal translation of each word in the input sentence (up to certain sentence lengths)
- Provide a coherent syntactical analysis of the input sentence based in part-of-speech tagging
- Provide response suggestions for the user to continue the conversation
- Generate inflections for a given word (experimental, Streamlit-only, German-only)

Currently, those features can be accessed via Chatbot-like UIs on both the
[Streamlit Community Cloud](https://lingolift.streamlit.app)
and [Telegram](https://t.me/lingolift_bot).

I'm currently working on error detection. Also, I'm looking to move away from language detection, instead focussing
on specific languages. Language detection is difficult and takes time; and this application won't work equally well
for all languages anyway, so it makes more sense to focus on a few languages and make them work well.

## Usage

I am hosting an instance of the application on the [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://lingolift.streamlit.app)
and on Telegram [here](https://t.me/lingolift_bot). The backend, as defined in this repository, is hosted as a set
of serverless functions on AWS Lambda, abstracted behind an API Gateway.

## Running

You can run the application locally as a dockerized Flask server. To do so, you need to have Docker installed
on your machine. Then, you can run the following commands:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:twaslowski/lingolift-core.git && cd lingolift-core
./do build_webserver
docker run -p 5001:5001 --env OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY> lingolift-webserver
```

The easiest option to interact with the provided endpoints is to clone the
[Streamlit-based frontend](https://github.com/twaslowski/lingolift-frontend) and run it locally:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:twaslowski/lingolift-frontend.git && cd lingolift-frontend
poetry install --no-root
./do run
```

## Contributing

All contributions are welcome! If you want to contribute, please fork the repository and create a pull request.
You can run tests with `./do test` and perform linting, import sorting and formatting with `./do pc` or
`pre-commit run --all-files`.

## Project Overview

The codebase for this project is split into four distinct repositories.
You are currently in the main repository that provides the backend functionality.
The primary frontend is hosted in the [lingolift-frontend](https://github.com/twaslowski/lingolift-frontend) repository.
The Telegram bot is hosted in the [lingolift-telegram-bot](https://github.com/twaslowski/lingolift-telegram-bot) repository.
Lastly, there is a [shared](https://github.com/twaslowski/lingolift-shared) repository that contains
client functionality for accessing the API provided here as well as models for all tasks to ensure type safety.
